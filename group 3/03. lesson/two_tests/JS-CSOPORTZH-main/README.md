# JS GROUPZH 2022-1

## Image Editing Assignment
The array in the first line of the `script.js` file contains the real group average scores for an image editing assignment. Solve the following tasks, preferably using array functions, and append the results to the appropriate places.

1. A score of 5 could be obtained if it exceeded 24 points. How many scores of 5 were there? `1 point`
2. What was the group average? `2 points`
3. An insufficient grade could be obtained if it was below 10 points. Was there anyone among the assignments who received an insufficient grade? If yes, print "Yes, there was.", if not, print "No, there wasn't.". `2 points`
4. The student who completed and uploaded the practice assignment could receive an additional 3 points for the assignment, and everyone took advantage of this opportunity. Add 3 points to each student and print the newly obtained array to the **Console**. `1 point`

## Table

1. When the button is clicked, generate a table with the specified number of rows and columns inside the `table` tag! `3 points`
2. Fill the cells with their indices. (It can be solved with a counter variable) `1 point`
3. We should be able to select two numbers in our table by clicking. Change the background of the selected numbers to any color. `2 points`
4. Save the `innerHTML` of the two selected cells into variable(s) or list, then display the product of the two numbers with the id `output`, for example `7 * 8 = 56`! `2 points`
5. After selecting and displaying two numbers, reset the background color of the cells to the original color. You can use the following commands for this purpose: `document.querySelectorAll()`, `ForEach`, `background-color: unset`! `2 points`
